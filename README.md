# Photo Album

> Photo album with simple `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` only.

All in one html file only, with no external css or JS files.<br>
No bootstrap, no jquery, no nothin'.<br>
To show how much can be created with just basic code.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/album_screenshot.png" alt="Photo album screenshot"
       width="654" height="377">
</p>

## Why this

This is a website for displaying my photos mostly to those who do not use social media, like Facebook or Instagram.<br>
It is also meant for those with barebones internet access around the globe (so no bootstrap, jquery, etc.).<br>
This "website" can also be easily displayed on my laptop when I travel (without internet).<br>
(Only a small sample of photos are shown.)
