# Photo Album

> Photo album with simple `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` only.

All in one html file only, with no external css or js files.<br>
No bootstrap, no jquery, no nothin'.<br>
To show how much can be created with just basic code.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/album_screenshot.png" alt="Photo album screenshot"
       width="654" height="377">
</p>

Photo caption changes on hover and photo opens on clicking.

## Why this

This is a website for displaying my photos mostly to those who do not use social media, like Facebook or Instagram,<br>
and who will not download any app to view an album either (yes, they still exist!). <br>
It is also meant for those with barebones internet access around the globe (so no bootstrap, jquery, etc.).<br>
Dual purpose:<br>
This "website" can also be easily displayed on my laptop &mdash; just as a photo album &mdash; when I travel (without internet).<br>
Photos & captions can be added/removed easily (just add photo to 'images' folder and add line with caption in html).<br>
(Only a small sample of photos are shown.)
