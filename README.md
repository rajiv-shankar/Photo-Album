## Source

This is a website for displaying my photos mostly to those who do not use social media, like Facebook or Instagram.
It is also meant for those with barebones internet access around the globe (so no bootstrap, jquery, etc.).
This "website" can also be easily displayed on my laptop when I travel (without internet).
